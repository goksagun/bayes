## Simple Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes classifiers, a family of classifiers that are based on the popular Bayesâ€™ probability theorem, are known for creating simple yet well performing models, especially in the fields of document classification and disease prediction.

In this first part of a series, we will take a look at the theory of naive Bayes classifiers and introduce the basic concepts of text classification. In following articles, we will implement those concepts to train a naive Bayes spam filter and apply naive Bayes to song classification based on lyrics.
